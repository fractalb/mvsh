# mvsh
When you rename a directory using this script, a log file (.rename-info)
will be created inside the directory for future reference.
All further name changes to that directory will be appended to the file.

If you like, add an alias of 'mv' to 'mv.sh'

Example log file '.rename-info':

renamed from util --> Tools on Mon, 25 Apr 2016 13:28:13 +0200
renamed from Tools --> util on Mon, 25 Apr 2016 13:29:08 +0200
